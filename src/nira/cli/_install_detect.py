"""Detect how Nira was installed so we can show the right upgrade
command (and run the right upgrade command for ``nira self-update``).

Three install paths are supported today:

- **PyPI** (``pip install nira``). The package lives somewhere
  inside ``site-packages``. Upgrade with ``pip install --upgrade nira``.
- **uv tool** (``uv tool install nira``). Lives in a uv-managed
  isolated venv under ``~/.local/share/uv/tools/``. Upgrade with
  ``uv tool upgrade nira``.
- **Editable git checkout** (``uv sync`` / ``pip install -e .`` from a
  cloned repo). The package's ``__file__`` is inside a working tree
  with a ``.git`` directory at the repo root. ``nira self-update`` repairs
  shallow Git history, fast-forwards the checkout, and rebuilds package metadata
  in the running environment without removing extras.

We detect by inspecting ``nira.__file__``. If we can't tell with
confidence we fall back to the PyPI command — that's the most common
case and the worst outcome is a no-op for a user who has nothing to
pull from PyPI.
